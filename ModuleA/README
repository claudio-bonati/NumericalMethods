*************************************************************

bad_rng : an example of a terrible random number generator 
          (look at the result in 3d...)

pi_no_rng: non stochastic determination of pi

pi_ss: pi determined by simple sampling

gauss_distr: test of the Box-Muller polar method to generate
             random number with Gaussian distribution

rew_problem: example to illustrate the problem of reweighting
             distributions. Two Gaussian with different 
             averages are used for the purpose

gauss_mcmc: gaussian number generator using Markov Chain MC

mcmc_analysis1: analysis of primary observables <x> and 
                <x^2> with binning

mcmc_analysis2: analysis of the secondary observable
                <x^4>/<x^2>^2 with binning and bootstrap

mcmc_analysis3: analysis of the secondary observable 
                <x^4>/<x^2>^2 with binning and jackknife

saw_ss: simple sampling for 2d self-avoiding random walk

saw_mcmc: MCMC for 2d self-avoiding random walk 
          (pivot algorithm)

ising: exact solution of the Ising mode by enumeration 
       (pay attention to overflow!)

ising_metro: Ising model sampled by the Metropolis algorithm

potts_metro: Potts model sampled by the Metropolis algorithm
             
ising_wolff: Ising model sampled by the Wolff single 
             cluster algorithm

ising_analysis: analyze data produced by the ising_* codes
                (as well as by on_metro)

on_metro: O(N) nonlinear sigma model sampled by metropolis and 
          microcanonical updates
