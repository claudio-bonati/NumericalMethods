*************************************************************

bad_rng: an example of a terrible random number generator 
         (look at the result in 3d...)

pi_no_rng: non stochastic determination of pi

pi_ss: pi determined by simple sampling

gauss_distr: test of the Box-Muller polar method to generate
             random number with Gaussian distribution

rew_problem: example to illustrate the problem of reweighting
             distributions. Two Gaussian with different 
             averages are used for the purpose

gauss_mcmc: gaussian number generator using Markov Chain MC

mcmc_analysis0: compute (without errors) the autocorrelation 
                function of the data (single column data)

mcmc_analysis1: analysis of primary observables <x>, <x^2> 
                and <x^4> with binning (single column data)

mcmc_analysis2: analysis of the secondary observable
                <x^4>/<x^2>^2 with binning and bootstrap
                (single column data)

mcmc_analysis3: analysis of the secondary observable 
                <x^4>/<x^2>^2 with binning and jackknife
                (single column data)

saw_ss: simple sampling for 2d self-avoiding random walk

saw_mcmc: MCMC for 2d self-avoiding random walk 
          (pivot algorithm)

ising: exact solution of the Ising model by enumeration 
       (small lattices only!)

ising2d_metro: 2d Ising model sampled by the Metropolis algorithm

ising_metro: Ising model sampled by the Metropolis algorithm

potts_metro: Potts model sampled by the Metropolis or
             Heatbath algorithm (which algorithm is used 
             depends on a macro in potts_model.c)
 
ising_wolff: Ising model sampled by the Wolff single 
             cluster algorithm

ising_analysis: analyze data produced by the ising_* codes
                (as well as by on_* and potts_metro)

on_metro: O(N) nonlinear sigma model sampled by Metropolis and 
          microcanonical updates (N set by a macro in nvector.h)

on_wolff: O(N) nonlinear sigma model sampled by the Wolff single
          cluster algorithm (N set by a macro in nvector.h)
