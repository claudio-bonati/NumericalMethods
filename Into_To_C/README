Introduction to C: some basic code to get acquainted with C

*************************************************************

arrays: basic arrays

hello_world: just what the name says...

command_line1: to introduce some command line functionalities

command_line2: a more complex example, with also file writing

dynamic_memory: dynamical allocation of memory

flow_control: for if while and all that

functions: some basic facts about functions and pointers

integrator: basic integration algorithms

integrator2: basic integration algorithms using int_lib.c and int_lib.h

rng: random number generator

struct: basic structures

types: basic types

types_complex: an explicit example with complex numbers

write_read: to read and write formatted files

*********

To compile the integrator2.c file, which depends on the library file int_lib.c
and on the header file int_lib.h, you have to use something like

gcc -c int_lib.c 
gcc -c integrator2.c 
gcc integrator2.o int_lib.o -o exe -lm

The first two commands produce the object files int_lib.o and integrator2.o,
respectively. The third lines link the object files and produces the executable
file exe.
